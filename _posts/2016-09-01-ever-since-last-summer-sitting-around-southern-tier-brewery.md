  Ever since last summer, sitting around Southern Tier Brewery with my brother
  Phil, I’ve wanted to create a Raspberry Wheat Ale. Now is the time. Looking to
  create a light bodied dry wheat ale with enough raspberry flavor but not to
  overwhelm you. I’ve chosen to add Mosaic and Bravo hops and throwing in a
  little lemon zest at the end of the boil to create a fun play in the flavor.
